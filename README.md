### 2. Global Power Plant Database Project
   - **Objective:** Utilize the Global Power Plant Database to analyze trends, patterns, and insights related to power generation, capacity, ownership, and fuel types across different countries.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The final regression model is **RandomForestRegressor** with an **R2 score of 73.111%** for predicting capacity_mw. The final classification model is **RandomForestClassifier** with an **accuracy score of 64.794%** for predicting primary_fuel.

### 3. Temperature Forecast Project
   - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to correct the bias in next-day maximum and minimum air temperature forecasts from the LDAPS model over Seoul, South Korea.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The final regression model is **RandomForestRegressor** with an **R2 score of 90.069%** for predicting Next_Tmax.

### 4. Loan Application Status Prediction Project
   - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant characteristics.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The best model was **ExtraTreesClassifier** with an **accuracy score of 87.77%**.

### 5. Census Income Prediction
   - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person earns over $50K per year based on demographic information from the 1994 Census Bureau database.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The best model was **ExtraTreesClassifier** with an **accuracy score of 91.394%**.

### 6. Rainfall Weather Forecasting
   - **Objective:** Develop machine learning models to accurately forecast whether it will rain tomorrow (binary classification) and the amount of rainfall (regression).
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The final regression model is **RandomForestRegressor** with an **R2 score of 83.15%** for predicting Rainfall. The final classification model is **ExtraTreesClassifier** with an **accuracy score of 91.34%** for predicting RainTomorrow.

### 7. Insurance Claim Fraud Detection Project
   - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict whether an insurance claim is fraudulent or not based on various factors.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The best-performing model was the **ExtraTreesClassifier**, achieving an **accuracy score of 93.919%**.

### 8. Avocado Project
   - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict weekly retail sales volume and price of Hass avocados based on historical data.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The best model was **ExtraTreesClassifier** with an **accuracy score of 93.4%**.

### 9. Baseball Case Study Project
   - **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the number of wins for a Major League Baseball team in the 2015 season based on various performance indicators.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The final model is **Lasso** with an **R2 score of 92.035%**.

### 10. HR Analytics Project
   - **Objective:** Analyze HR data to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition. Develop a predictive model to forecast employee turnover and inform retention strategies.
   - **Predicted Outcomes:** The best model was **ExtraTreesClassifier** with an **accuracy score of 95%**.

## Conclusion
